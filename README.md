# Final-Project
I created a fantasy football app that lets a user create an account where they can make a team. The main function is the user to be able to register and login and logout. After login they'll be able to access the create team page which isnt visible unless the user has logged in. With the create team page the user will create a team that is unique to them. Meaning 2 user won't be able to have the same team. If a user choses a name for a team similar to another user they face an error asking them to choice a diffent name. The same concept is applied to the registration page where username and email have to be unique. The login page requires correct authenication to pass through or else user will face a warning asking them to check their username and password they have inputted.
